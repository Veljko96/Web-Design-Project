In its range of activities, the Dom omladine includes all artistic disciplines and forms: music, film, theater, visual arts and new media. Discussion and discussion programs are also equally important in the program activities, which analyze current topics from different fields (popular and traditional culture, philosophy, social issues, science, literature, science fiction, music ...), but also programs based at the juncture of art and science. Special attention is paid to the educational program, which is completely free for pupils and students, and it is realized through numerous workshops and lectures from various fields. Since the beginning of 2014, the Youth Center of Belgrade has a modern equipped IT corner, which is used for youth education and as a platform for launching their start-up projects. One of the basic tasks of the Belgrade Youth Center is to continually create the conditions for additional education of young people, through informal and peer education, but also to enable them to creatively express themselves, to create and realize themselves. The eligibility is done in more space, over 5000 m2 : Grand Hall, Hall of the Americas, DOB Club, DOB Gallery, Tribunal Hall on the 1st floor, Holovi, IT Corner, "Zidic" scene at Platou Milen Mladenovic in front of the Youth Center of Belgrade, American Corner, EU Info Center, as well as "Depandance" Kraljevića Marka 4 and 8. All rooms are fully accessible to people with disabilities - The Belgrade Youth Center is equipped with a special lift for wheelchair users, as well as inductive loops that allow hearing impaired people to follow the program, and the entrances are marked with inscriptions on Braille's alphabet .
