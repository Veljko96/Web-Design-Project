                            <h1 class="row-big-title">About festival</h1><p class="lead">The first MARVEL, under the title "Brave New World", was opened on January 9, 1971 in the Dom of the Union, projection of the film "Mesh" by Robert Altman. Designed as an annual cross-section of the best films of the season, the Belgrade International Film Festival MARVEL has grown to become one of the most important film reviews and has become one of the main events in the cultural life of Belgrade, with many young adults grown.<br/></p>

                    	<div class="page-content">

							<p>What has adorned him all the past years is the fact that he was wide open to all the cinemas of the world, to all relevant authors, but also to movies that will not be found on the cinema repertoire. The importance of MARVEL FEST is reflected in the fact that the Belgrade audience - with the films of some of the greatest directors of today such as Teo Angelopulos, Bob Rafelson, Volker Schlendorf, David Kronenberg, Ken Russell, Vim Venders, Kishlovsky, Hercog ... had the opportunity to meet for the first time just at MARVEL.</p>

							<p>Already the first MARVEL began to be quite spectacular, on it they found: &rdquo; Odyssey in the universe &rdquo; Stenlija Kubrika, &rdquo; Naked in saddle &rdquo; Denisa Hopera, mentioned &rdquo; Mesh &rdquo; Robert Altman, films of Erik Romer, Luis Bunuel, Zivojin Pavlovic ... Although many, from nostalgia but rightly, consider the first edition of FEST unforgettable, it is true that in the coming years at MARVEL we were watching movies that will remain recorded in history of world cinema. In the history of the festival, numerous great actors and directors of the festival were also included: Marcelo Mastrojani, Harvey Kaytel, Liv Ulman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Sofia Loren, Robert De Niro, Antonioni, Johnny Depp, Milos Forman, Katrin Danev, Vim Venders , Abaz Kjarostami, Hana Šigula, previously mentioned authors Rafelson, Schlendorf, Russell ... the list is very impressive, honorable and long.</p>

							<p>Since its inception, MARVEL has always had major and several accompanying programs, which by their quality often exceeded the name &ldquo; by following &rdquo;. &ldquo; Followed & rdquo; there were also numerous publications, exhibitions, symposiums that were held during the festival. &nbsp;</p>

							<p>So far - MARVEL has had about four million viewers and nearly 4,000 significant world films - who had a Yugoslav / Serbian and often a regional premier on it.</p>

							<p>Although the first MARVEL was held more than 40 years ago, this year with the same energy continues its big cultural and educational task extending the film horizons to all fans of film art.</p>

							<p>2015, MARVEL becomes a true competition festival with four competitive selections: the main competition program - international selection, the program Serbian Film - National Selection, the program Granice - subversive and controversial films and films from the region that compete for the Nebojsa Djukelić Prize.</p>

							<p>Another novelty is the introduction of the Belgrade Winner Award for outstanding contribution to film art, as well as the Belgrade Winner for the present creativity.</p>
