				Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds continue to win our hearts again and again with every public appearance they bless us with. The pair stepped out on May 14 to celebrate the premiere of Ryan's film Deadpool 2, and they only had eyes for each other.

				While we're used to chuckling on our own over Blake and Ryan's back-and-forth social media comments, it appears the couple spent time swapping private jokes IRL on the red carpet. Just look at Ryan whisper in her ear — our hearts, they melt. They were even caught in their signature couples pose (they pinned one down before they started dating)! Keep scrolling to see more pics of the duo's night out, and feel free to reminisce on the days when they first fell in love.

				Chadwick Boseman, fresh off “Black Panther,” Avengers stalwarts, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo, and newer Marvel entrants Tom Holland and Evangeline Lilly, who will portray the Wasp in this summer’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” were among the superheroes in attendance.

				The long list of stars who walked the carpet to meet fans, catch up with fellow cast members and answer questions from reporters delayed the start of the screening by nearly an hour, but no one seemed to mind.

				The premiere was among Disney’s most heavily-guarded and secured event in recent memory, with a large perimeter surrounding Hollywood Boulevard, which was closed in front of the Hollywood and Highland center. Attendees were able to see the film was on three different screens, including one in the Dolby Theater.

				The purple carpet stretched almost the entire block and featured costumes and other memorabilia from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fans also did their best cosplays, coming dressed up like Super-Man, Dr. Strange and Black Widow, among others.

			<h3 class="h3" style="margin-bottom: 1%">Why Christopher Nolan 'begged' Tom Hardy to star in 'Dunkirk'</h3>
			<img class="img-fluid float-left rounded" src="nolan-hardy.jpg" width="50%" height="20%" style="margin-right: 1%;">

				Writer/director Christopher Nolan didn't write the part of the impossibly unflappable Spitfire pilot Farrier in Dunkirk with one actor in mind.

				But once Nolan had written it, he knew there could only be one actor to play Farrier for the action thriller in theaters now: Tom Hardy.

				"I don’t write with actors in mind, because I think that somewhat does them a disservice," says Nolan. "But once it was done, I could only see Tom in it. So I called him and begged... in a dignified manner."

				Nolan knew that Hardy would make the most of the part with few words or physical movement while in the Spitfire cockpit — engaged in dogfights with German Messerschmitt Bf 109 planes during the Battle of Dunkirk.

				Why 'Dunkirk' is mandatory IMAX viewing: Straight Up Hollywood podcast

				"We’re in that cockpit with him for the entire film. So it’s about wiping the sweat out of his eyes or whatever, it’s very small scale. There's two feet right around him. I knew (Hardy) would be interested in that," says Nolan. "It’s rare to find that and embrace that restriction. By tying his arm around his back and making him do something different, I knew he would have something amazing to bring to that." 

				'Dunkirk': How historically accurate is Christopher Nolan's WWII battle film? 

				Nolan pointed to the performance in the 2014 film Locke, which featured Hardy's character shot entirely in the driver's seat of a car talking on his mobile phone, as an example of the actor's ability to master a small space.

				Farrier also has a pilot oxygen mask around his mouth for much of the film, leaving the viewer's attention on Hardy's fully expressive eyes — much like Hardy's villainous Bane in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises.

				"I’ve had great experience hiding Tom behind masks and showing that he can act with only his eyes," says Nolan. "It's all there, he has the most expressive eyes. He can pull the audience into the moment in an amazing way even with most of his face covered."
